      Kodi v20 (Nexus) is the next iteration of Kodi. It has a number of new
      features and lots of fixes.


      The **Release Candidate 1** pre-release build has become available because we think it is ready for wider testing and usage. It also means we are getting closer to a stable release of v20.

    title: Kodi v19, v20 & v21 Nightly Development Builds
    description: >-
      **Nightly builds** are made on a daily basis and contain the most recent
      changes. These should be considered unstable for daily usage and should
      only be used by testers and advanced users to help us find possible bugs.


      These builds may occassionally be unstable, so be sure to always backup before using a development/nightly build.


      If you want a stable setup, then please install a stable build from the **Recommended** tab instead.
