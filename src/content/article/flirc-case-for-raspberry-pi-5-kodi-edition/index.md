Team Flirc and Team Kodi are thrilled to introduce the newly designed Flirc Raspberry Pi 5 Case, Kodi Edition. Available now!

Our journey began with a host of ideas that we transformed into a crowdsourcing poll on the Kodi forums. The community chose from six designs, and we loved seeing your preferences and hearing your feedback. We’re excited to continue this collaborative approach because, just as Kodi is community-driven, so should its official case be.

With only about 2,000 cases available, this is a truly limited edition. Once sold out, we won’t produce more. Instead, every quarter, we’ll engage with the community again, allowing you to submit and vote on new ideas for another limited run.

With each purchase, you’re helping fund the Kodi team’s ongoing development and innovation.

On top of our Black Friday - Cyber Monday deals, enjoy an extra 10-15% off when you purchase a Kodi Edition Raspberry Pi 5 case, which can be used on our Flirc USB or Skip 1s Universal Remote.

A heartfelt thanks to the Kodi Team, our loyal customers, community members, and everyone who contributed to the design.

Happy Thanksgiving!
