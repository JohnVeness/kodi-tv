Time flies, and we're already at the third and final day of DevCon 2024. We'll be losing some people today as they head home, which will shorten events, and most of the day is scheduled for the inevitable people-sitting-together-and-hacking-code later today, which will also eat into time, so this will inevitably be a short post.

Random, spontaneous, unstructured conversations about **mirrors**, more about **release cycles**, about **merging**. A wild conversation about a potential **third-party conference in south Asia**, and how any of us would physically get there (especially as some of our members don't fly for climate reasons, and we can't afford it anyway). Various debates about the **DVB specification**, **EITs** and **embedded EPG data** in different countries/formats around the planet. Much about **IPTV**, **metadata**, **scrapers**, **servers** and **cloud services**, a chunk on **permission cleanup** and **retired team members**, some cosmetic **website changes**, debates about **skins** and the **out-of-the-box experience** when installing Kodi for the first time, and general chat about all things AV-related.

After a good chunk of reminiscing about events and team members past, we ended the conference with a bit of a reflection on **Devcon itself** - the format, the location, accessibility, what we've done while we're here. If we're to do this again - and we certainly want to - then we need to find ways of maximising the value and minimising the cost.

So, that's it: as suitcases are already trundling into the distance, DevCon 2024 draws to a close. Thanks for following, we hope that you've found these posts informative, and thanks for continuing to support Kodi.
