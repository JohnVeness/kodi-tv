Okay, a late announcement - apologies, you can blame the summer holiday season. Or, if it's easier, you can just blame me as the bloke with the keyboard, that works equally well. Either way, many of you will already have noticed this, but, in case you haven't - Team Kodi is here with the first point release of the 21.x "Omega" series.

A range of bugfixes have been collected since the original release of Omega 21.0. Rather than list them all here, you can see the full changelog on [Github](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/compare/21.0-Omega...21.1-Omega), as usual.

We always want to thank everyone who has helped us track down and fix any issues. We endeavour to minimise the issues everyone experiences, but with such a large project, and the fact everyone contributing to Kodi is a volunteer, issues and bugs are a part of life. If you happen to experience any bugs/issues, don't hesitate to reach out on the forums, or raise an issue on Github.

As this is a point release, there are no major changes since the previous version, and you should be fine to install this straight over the top of any existing Kodi 21.0 installation - indeed, this will happen, and probably already has happened, automatically on many platforms. However, as for all software installations, back up your userdata beforehand if you've any doubts or have anything you can't afford to lose (and definitely do this if you're going for a major version upgrade).

A list of all changes for this version can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/milestone/167?closed=1). If you want to read back on the full history of v21 itself, or of previous versions, you can find the corresponding articles in the relevant [blog posts](https://kodi.tv/blog/tag/release).

Application deployment on different platforms (notably the Microsoft Store) can vary considerably due to circumstances outside of our control, so just be patient, and the update will inevitably find its way through.

**Android Deployment**

We always do what's known as a "staged" deployment roll out for Android. So if you didn't  receive the update immediately, it should have come through over the following week or so, and rollout should now be complete.
