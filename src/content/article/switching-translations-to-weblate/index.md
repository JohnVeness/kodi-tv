The moment is here to move to an even more optimal translation service for our application. Ultimately we have chosen Weblate, and its service will be hosted at <https://kodi.weblate.cloud/>.

This is done to optimize our workflow and to allow easy inclusion of all add-ons in the official Kodi add-on repository.

The transition has taken its time during at least the last year, so if you have made any requests at Transifex for new languages or team additions in that period, we're sorry we couldn't implement them.

All current translations have been transferred to Weblate, and we would like to thank you for all your efforts in making Kodi the multi-lingual success it is. We hope you will join us in our revived efforts to make Kodi accessible to even more languages using Weblate.

For now, our most current resources at Transifex are locked, meaning translators will no longer have access. The final switch over to Weblate is planned for July the 14th, 2021. We hope to see you all there.

Please sign up at Weblate here:

<https://kodi.weblate.cloud/accounts/register/>

[](https://kodi.weblate.cloud/accounts/register/)You can visit this forum post to let us know which language team you would like access to (and if you are a coordinator for that language): <https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=363132>

We encourage all add-on developers with add-ons in the official Kodi add-on repository to submit their add-ons for translation: <https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=363251&pid=3045468#pid3045468>

Best regards,

The Kodi Translations Team
