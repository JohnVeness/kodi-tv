  alt: A grand street, with dressed stone buildings to each side. A cobbled road -
    clean and gleaming in the sunshine, the dark stone contrasting with the
    bleached buildings in the early spring sunshine. A cathedral can be seen
    just down the road, enticing the viewer to walk just a little further.
