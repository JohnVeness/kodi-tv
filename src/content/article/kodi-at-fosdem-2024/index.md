Hi!

This is just a quick note to let everyone know that Team Kodi will be present at the [Free and Open Source Developers European Meeting (FOSDEM)](fosdem.org) in Brussels on 3 & 4 February 2024. We will have a **[booth in Building H level 1](https://fosdem.org/2024/stands/)** where you can try out Kodi and chat with us at your leisure :)

We have team members attending that are knowledgeable about, among other things, Python add-on programming, Kodi on Linux, the Kodi flatpak package, and Kodi on embedded GPUs.

If you're in the area, we'd love to see you and get your first-hand feedback about ... well, anything, really. Please, join us for a chat and a coffee!
