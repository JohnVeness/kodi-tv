Just a scratch post to play with formatting and similar - see how it works and looks in the build preview.

Some images, to see if they render side-by-side:

![](/images/blog/kore-3.0-screenshot-1.webp)

![](/images/blog/kore-3.0-screenshot-2.webp)

The same, but edited in markdown to have no newline between:

![](/images/blog/kore-3.0-screenshot-1.webp) ![](/images/blog/kore-3.0-screenshot-2.webp)

then some text, then a single image:

![](/images/blog/kore-3.0-screenshot-3.webp)

... and then a wider one:

![](/images/blog/kore-3.0-screenshot-4.webp)
