Hi, everyone! I am Mohd. Shaheer, Computer Science undergrad in freshman year. I am a GSoC contributor working on the project ‚ÄúFinish the web interface‚Äù for Kodi. I have been working on this project for the past 3 months. This blog post contains my experience through phase 2 (Final evaluation) of GSoC and an overview of my work during that period.

In my previous blog, I wrote about my work up until the mid-evaluation of GSoC. You can find it [here](https://medium.com/@mshaheer2003/gsoc-2022-kodi-mid-term-evaluation-bb0167390d21).

**Phase 2 (July 25th ‚Äî September 5)**

This phase turned out to be more challenging than the previous one.
During this phase, the first functionality I worked on was ‚ÄúImplementing the Video playback‚Äù which involved working on the following pages ‚Äî Music Video, Movies, Tv Show, Seasons, and Episode.

I started with the **videoid_int** page, which contains information about a music video. Before that, I noticed that we didn‚Äôt have a working Music video page (previously implemented). There were some inconsistencies with its routing, with the json-rpc calls which fetched the metadata and with elm json decoders. So, I fixed these issues first.

I worked on the front end and created its UI from scratch which included rework of the music-video card UI. The basic approach in order to implement video playback functionality was by using JSON-RPC **Files.PreparedDownload** method, we can get a `PreparedDownload` path for the file which we want to play by making a request in this manner :

`{"jsonrpc":"2.0", "id":1, "method":"Files.PrepareDownload", "params":{ "path": "/home/xyz/Videos/test.mp4" }}`

We can expect the returned `PreparedDownload` path to be something like - `"vfs/%2fhome%2fxyz%2fVideos%2ftest.mp4"` which we can be fed into the src of the html5 video player
`(‚Äúhttp://localhost:8080/vfs/%2fhome%2fxyz%2fVideos%2ftest.mp4‚Äù)`

An issue arose when we tried to do so ‚Äî [CORS Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). Since we were sending an HTTP request to fetch the JSON data from the Kodi RPC server, we were facing issues with it. Therefore to work on it during development, I suggested using an extension in a browser that allows CORS. Web sockets, which were used to retrieve json data, could have made things much simpler, but during development, things don‚Äôt always go according to plan :).

In Chorus 2, the video playback was done through a pop-up window that had an HTML5 Player. To make the user experience better, I implemented a modal for it.

In a similar manner, I implemented the video playback functionality for the **movideid_int** page where I implemented the page‚Äôs UI from scratch, worked on its routing, modified json decoders, and created new ones from scratch.

Tvshow pages required more time and effort than others. I implemented its UI, front-end, and backend from scratch. I also had to create two new pages from scratch ‚Äî The seasons and the Episode page. I created new objects and decoders for each of them and wrote JSON RPC calls to fetch data for them.

Another functionality that I worked on was ‚ÄúFilter functionality‚Äù for all the pages. I created a fully working front-end and wrote filter methods that would filter the objects based on particular fields such as genre, artist, album, etc.

While working on the functionalities, I also reworked the UI of previously implemented cards and pages. For example:

**Top Music Page**

**Album page**

On September 5th, the official coding phase of GSoC ended. It was a great learning experience and my first internship in freshman year. I learned a lot and would love to keep contributing to Kodi on this project and help in any way possible.

Again I would like to thank my mentor ‚Äî Razze üòÑ and Kodi Community for being so supportive, and helpful, and for making sure to give positive feedback about my work which kept me motivated.
