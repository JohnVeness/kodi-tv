# Becoming a Kodi Foundation Sponsor

Kodi is a fairly expensive operation to maintain, and as such, we are always happy to welcome new sponsors to the fold. Additional sponsorships make it easier to maintain our infrastructure, further development the app and to spread the word. To become an Kodi Foundation sponsor, any organization may simply contact the Kodi Foundation by email to contact (AT) kodi.tv.

The Kodi Foundation remains a non-profit organization, and as such, we would like very much to combine clear financial management with definite software and community growth. Towards this, we ask that all potential sponsors answer the following brief questions in their contact email:

1. In a paragraph, could you tell us a bit about your organization?
1. Why would you like to become a Kodi Foundation sponsor?
1. What efforts have you made (if any) to support, promote and/or advance Open Source Software generally and Kodi specifically?
1. What level of sponsorship are you interested in?
